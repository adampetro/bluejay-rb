`bluejay-rb` is a GraphQL engine for Ruby written primarily in Rust through the use of [`magnus`](https://github.com/matsadler/magnus).

## Goal

`bluejay-rb`'s goal is to provide a lightning fast GraphQL engine with first-class integration with [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/).

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add bluejay

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install bluejay

## Usage

See an example in the [`/example`](/example) directory. Note the usage of [Tapioca](https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca) RBI generation for the DSL at [`/example/sorbet/rbi/dsl/graph`](/example/sorbet/rbi/dsl/graph)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
